# TimeMachine

### Introduction

Time Machine is a Dynamic Delay-Based Audio Effects Module that allows the user to be able to alter and remix audio in real time. Dynamic Delay-Based Audio Effects allow the user to perform momentary repeat loops, rearrange the rhythm, change playback speed, reverse, stutter, vinyl scratch effects, flanger effects, and other effects over a 4 beat sequence. There are 25 different audio effects to choose from. The user can load up to 12 different delay-based audio effects onto a push button pad so that the user can try different combinations of effects. The user just has to plug in their media device, plug in a speaker, use the tap tempo to sync the device to any song and they are ready to play with time.
