### Introduction

Time Machine is a Dynamic Delay-Based Audio Effects Module that can alter and remix audio in real time. Anybody can sound like a professional DJ with this machine. Dynamic Delay-Based Audio Effects can perform momentary repeat loops, rearrange the rhythm, change playback speed, reverse, stutter, vinyl scratch effects, flanger effects, and other effects over a 4 beat sequence. The BPM (beats per minute) of the device is set using a Tap Tempo on the touch screen GUI. The Tap Tempo is used to syncronize the sequence with the BPM of any song. There are 25 different audio effect sequences to choose from. Up to 12 different delay-based audio effects can be loaded onto 12 different push buttons. The effect button pad layout can be configured in any order. Effects and their respective buttons are selected on the touch screen GUI. A music source and a speaker are plugged into the 3.5mm audio jack input and output.
