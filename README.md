# TimeMachine

##Introduction

Time Machine utilizes delay-based audio effects that allow the user to be able to alter and remix music in real time. Time Machine has 25 different delay-based audio effects to choose from that allow the user to change the rhythm of any song in different ways. They also allow the user to perform momentary repeat loops, speed up, slow down, reverse, stutter, vinyl scratch effects, and change pitch. The user can load up to 12 different delay-based audio effects onto a push button pad so that the user can try different combinations of effects.
