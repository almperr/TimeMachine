# TimeMachine

### Introduction

Time Machine is a Dynamic Delay-Based Audio Effects Module that can alter and remix audio in real time. Anybody can sound like a professional DJ with this machine. Time Machine is a powerful tool that can perform momentary repeat loops, rearrange the rhythm, change playback speed, reverse, stutter, vinyl scratch effects, flanger effects, and other DJ effects over a 4 beat sequence. A Tap Tempo, on the touch screen GUI, is used in order to syncronize the device BPM (beats per minute) to the BPM of any song that is played through it. There are 25 different audio effect sequences to choose from. A 12 button push pad is used to activate the effects. The effect button pad layout can be configured in any order. Effects and their respective buttons are selected on the touch screen GUI. A music source and a speaker are plugged into the 3.5mm audio input and output jacks. This is a working prototype. Inspiration for this machine came from a VST Plug-In called Gross Beat by Image Line.
